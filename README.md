music/rhythm game, developed in Unity 5 with C#

Trying to create something like 02Jam, a rhythm game popular before 2006ish.

Emphasis is on response when pressing keys. This means that individual sound files have to be assigned whenever a key is pressed. For a comparison, taptap on iOS does not have responsive controls. There is no audible response to keypresses.

Also, the latency should be shorter than it is now, although I don't know how much of it is because of my implementation or the Unity Engine.
